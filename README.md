This contains three packages. 
The first is employeeComparator.
This is a simple comparator class to compare employees by name. Alternatively the commented code could be used to compare by ID or salary.
The second is rationalComparator.
This compares two rational objects and sorts them in ascending order using a compareTo method. A seperate comparator class is made to sort in descending order. Methods exist in Rational.java to add, subtract, multiply and dividde rational numbers together.
The third is vehicleComparator.
This is a simple comparator class to compare a list of vehicles by engine size.
